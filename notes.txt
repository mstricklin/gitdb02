Use proxy!!

o have DataStore be per-data-context
o keep a complete list of path->actual object mappings
o load all mappings at DataStore creation/re-creation time
o skip persisting, for now
o keep added/deleted list, add to (per-context) canonical map at commit-time

o objects should have a programmer-generated 'id' (maps to old __id)
o objects should have a db-generated 'key'
o key is used to generate 'path' which is type/key
o key is per DataStore, unnecessary (for now) to be globally unique.
o register at start-up mappings of String->class, which is an Impl
o Impl has a proxy() method which returns the interface class wrapping the impl
o Pass to DS an un-built 'Builder' which the db sets the key on, then builds, then returns
o DS can list(<type>) by easily finding all entries <type>/*


Test merging into a bare repo

o use impl/mutableImpl
o make path a first-class type


TODO:
load at start-up
persist at commit
make Path a 1st-class type
list all
list by type
decide on Proxy inheritance or annotation
